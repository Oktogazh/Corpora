A "flow" designates a group of functions and data structures acting together in order to build a fully fledge feature, on the top of which, other flows can be designed. Thus, they should be developed in order, from the most depended on flow to the most dependent. in the chart below, dependence is indicated through indentation. A flow should be broken down into as many flows as possible for clarity sake and ease of development scheduling (ie. rating system being broken into voting and Elo rating ones).
