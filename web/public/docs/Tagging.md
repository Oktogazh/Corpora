The language labelling sends to a label page, which contains:
- a list of most recent strings translated in the language
- stats on languages translated from, translated to under this label
- several fields that can be preferred following the same system as posts:
	- a list of dialects labels, if the language is a dialect, a link to the "root" label is automatically added
	- name of the language in the language
	- description of the language in the language
	- when a description is preferred: publish it as a post
