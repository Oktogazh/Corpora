A user can propose a translation to a post and indicate the language of the translation.
In the segment translation interface, users can view translations per language, and vote for the favorite translations following these criteria:
- many translations may be accepted as correct translations
- a user can only vote for one favorite translation
- every time a translation is added, the favorite translations count is downed to zero
The translation is published in the same user's translation as the one who published the original post, not the translators.
